# RV32I Simulator

Welcome to the RV32I Simulator repository. This project is designed as part of the ECE GY - 6913: Computing Systems Architecture course. The simulator facilitates the execution of RISC-V test cases in a single-staged pipeline architecture.

## Dependencies

The simulator depends on the following Python packages:

- `riscv-model==0.6.6`
- `bitstring~=4.0.1`

These can be installed via pip using the following commands:

```sh
pip install riscv-model==0.6.6
pip install bitstring~=4.0.1
```

Ensure that your pip is up-to-date to avoid any installation issues.

## Running the Simulator

Follow these steps to run the simulator:

1. Prepare an `input` directory at the root of the project, containing all the RISC-V test cases you intend to simulate.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the `main.py` script with Python 3:

```sh
python3 netid/main.py
```

*Note: Replace `netid` with the directory name where your `main.py` file resides.*

3. After successful execution, the simulator will generate an `output` directory with the results for each test case.

## Output Format

The output consists of detailed execution results for each test case, showcasing the workings of a single-stage pipelined RISC-V processor.
